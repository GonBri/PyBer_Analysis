# PyBer_Analysis


1. Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. For this I need to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each week.


2. Results:

3. Summary:

The Fare rates between the city types are really high, while the average fare per ride in the Urban city type averages $24.53 the average fare per ride on the rural city type has an average of $34.62, this could be one indicator why the people who lives on the rural area does not use the services of PyBer. 
My recomendations are:
     1. To lower the fare rates for the rural city type to attract more customers to try the Pyber App
     2. To offer a bonus incentive to the current drivers to work more hours 
     2. To offer a bonus incentive to new drivers on the rural area once they reach a certain amount of trips.
